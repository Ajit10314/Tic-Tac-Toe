# Tic-Tac-Toe
The Tic Tac Toe project is a web-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides an interactive platform for two players to play the classic game, taking turns to place their marks ("X" or "O") in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
This project is an excellent introduction to web development, covering event handling, DOM manipulation, and basic game logic. It provides a foundational understanding of how to create interactive web applications.
